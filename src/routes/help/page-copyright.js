              <h3>If You Believe Your Transmission was Removed Pursuant to a Copyright Complaint (DMCA) Notification.</h3>
              <p>[[env.siteName]] may remove content for any reason, including due to flagging by other users as inappropriate. A transmission might also be removed due a copyright complaint, meaning the transmission’s content has been deleted from [[env.siteName]]’s Service at the request of the content’s copyright owner. If a user transmits too much content that receives copyright complaints, that user identification may lose the ability to contribute new content to [[env.siteName]], and may be disabled. At your written request we will provide you with the copyright complaint filed against your content.</p>
              <p>If you take the position that your content was removed in error, you may file a counter- notice by following the steps below. When we receive a valid counter-notice, we will send a copy to the party who filed the original complaint. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the original complaining party is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement, we will remove the complaint from your user record, and we may choose to replace the content that was removed.</p>
              <p>Note: There are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith notices. Before submitting a counter-notice, be sure that you are the actual rights holder of the removed content or that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and that you understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.</p>
              <p><strong>How to File a Counter-Notice</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Reply to the copyright complaint we send you at your request.</li>
                  <li>Include ALL of the following:</li>
                  <ol>
                      <li>Your name, address, and telephone number.</li>
                      <li>DMCA ID shown at the bottom of the notification email.</li>
                      <li>A copy of the actual content you posted and its image identification (see above instructions) plus the approximate date that you posted this content</li>
                      <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed in error.</li>
                      <li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which [[env.siteName]] may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.</li>
                      <li>A physical or electronic signature (for example, typing your full name).</li>
