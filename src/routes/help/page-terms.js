                <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p><strong>The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States.</strong> [[env.siteName]] makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable national, state, local or other laws, statutes, directives, rules, regulations, and all interpretations or orders of any government, administrative or regulatory authority or court, including but not limited to those related to export and import of software, technical information or services. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.</p>
                <h3>Arbitration and Governing Law</h3>
                <p><strong>You Agree to Arbitrate Our Disputes in Northern California.</strong> For any dispute you have with [[env.siteName]], you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:[[env.supportEmail]]">[[env.supportEmail]]</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that [[env.siteName]] has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS commenced and conducted in San Francisco, California. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND [[env.siteName]] ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
                <p><strong>Governing Law.</strong> You agree that: (i) the Site shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Site shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over [[env.siteName]], either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, California or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, for any actions for which either party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, as further described in the Arbitration provision above.</p>
                <h3>General Terms</h3>

                <p><strong>Entire Agreement/Severability.</strong> These Terms, the <a href="/help/privacy">Privacy Notice</a>, the <a href="/help/use">Acceptable Use Policy</a> and the <a href="/help/copyright">Copyright Policy</a>, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with [[env.siteName]] in connection with the Site, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and [[env.siteName]] concerning the Site. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
                <p><strong>No Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and [[env.siteName]]’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
                <p><strong>Contact.</strong> Please contact us at <a href="mailto:[[env.supportEmail]]">[[env.supportEmail]]</a> with any questions regarding these Terms.</p>
